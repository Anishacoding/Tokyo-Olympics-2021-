# Tokyo-Olympics-2021
# Welcome to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project for the Tokyo 2021 Summer Olympics. This project dives into the medal distribution, country-wise performance, and key patterns from the event using Python and visualization libraries.

Project Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Tokyo Olympics 2021 dataset to uncover trends and insights related to:

a. Medal counts across countries

b. Gold, Silver, Bronze distributions

c. Performance correlations

d. Outliers and distribution characteristics using visualizations

The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle and contains medal counts for each participating country
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunprasadsarkhel/2021-olympics-in-tokyo?resource=download 

Columns include:

Team/NOC: Country name or Olympic Committee code

Rank: Official ranking

Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total: Medal counts

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

a. Python (Pandas, NumPy)

b. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

c. Jupyter Notebook for analysis and plotting

d. GitHub for version control and sharing

ðŸ“Š Key Analyses Performed

Descriptive Statistics: 

Understanding basic distributions (mean, median, mode, etc.)

Box Plots: 

Visualizing medal count spread and detecting outliers

Violin Plots:

Comparing distributions with smoothed density curves

Density Plots: 

Understanding probability distributions of medal counts

Frequency Tables: 

Binning and counting how medals are distributed across countries

Hexbin & KDE Plots: 

Visualizing bivariate distributions (e.g., Gold vs Silver)

Pivot Tables (Contingency Tables): 

Analyzing medal count combinations across teams

Weighted Mean & Median: Highlighting how total medals influence averages

ðŸ“ˆ Notable Insights
A few countries dominate the medal tally significantly (e.g., USA, China).

Most countries win between 0â€“5 medals, highlighting the competitive gap.

Thereâ€™s a positive correlation between gold and silver counts among top-performing nations.

Violin and KDE plots reveal skewness in medal distributions.

Weighted statistics give better insights into performance-adjusted measures.
